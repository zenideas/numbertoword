# numbertoword
A quick way to express a number into words


This JS is first converted from some VBA scripts popularly available in the excel videos. Most probably the original version was done by Microsoft and then a Rupee version was done by some indians. But the problem is this VBA outputs only in ASCII format. So, I was looking to turn it into Unicode. But later found VBA does not support unicode normally. And there are other problems like retaining the exact spelling of number expression in ASCII format.

For example you'll see some gibberish if you try 40 to 48 in the VBA. It does not support numbers beyond 99,99,99,999. I added few placeholders to increase the range but it would fail with large numbers where places under are not at least 1.

This is not my intellectual property. You dont have to credit me to use it at all.

Usage: save the htm file to your computer and then start using the file.
